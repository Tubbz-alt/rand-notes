Random Notes - No Source Code

This is just a central repository for notes and lists that I want to access from a variety of endpoints and locations.

License references will be inserted into individual files as needed.

I have been working on some complex issues...  Hofstadter's Law still applies.  
Hofstadter's Law states that "It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law."
