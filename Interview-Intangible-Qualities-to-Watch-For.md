For interviewers:

- **Enthusiastic**: More *heart* than *pressure* on this characteristic.

- **Self-Improving**:  Teams require that individuals evolve in ways that improve their collective capabilities.  This is **not** about looking at the latest *shiny* objects...  
- **Tenacious**:  
- **Competent**:
