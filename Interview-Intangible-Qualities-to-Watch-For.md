***Reminder List For interviewers:

There are a number of intangibles that are also important for your team's, your organization's success.  

**Listen for indicators of being:  

- **Communicative**: Can this candidate communicate easily and in ways that may facilitate the '*frictionless*' exchange of thoughts and ideas across a diverse collection of individuals?  
- **Collaborative**: Working effectively together in a diverse environment is essential - it is foundational.  Ensure that you understand enough about this characteristic before making an offer to anyone.  
- **Adaptabile**: Can this candidate evolve with/for the team?  
- **Curious**: New options, opportunities, *connections*, ideas, or new ways to frame old issues, can feed service quality and productivity.   
- **Committed**: This *may* be an expression of their motivations, but regardless, *half-hearted* workers are a drag on any team.  
- **Enthusiastic**: More *heart* than *pressure* on this characteristic.    
- **Prepared**: All candidates need to meet some threshold of *being ready* for the current and target operational environment.  That *readiness* has many dimensions -- some are listed on this page.  Be as explicit as practical about evaluations on this dimension of any given candidate's fit.  
- **Mission Conscious**: Technology is not the goal.  The strategic and tactical goals remain in focus throughout all facets of their work.  
- **Self-Improving**:  Teams require that individuals evolve in ways that improve their collective capabilities.  This is **not** about looking at the latest *shiny* objects...  
- **Tenacious**: In the course of normal business operations and evolution, there are a lot of *hard* problems that require serious, focused concentration and commitment.  Candidates need to exhibit the ability to stick with difficult challenges.  
- **Competent**:  
- **Disciplined**: This is a relative of *focus*.  It gets at the candidate's ability to manage, for example, their interests and curiousity in the interest of meeting given  
- **Intentional**: The macro aspect of this characteristic relates to a candidate's conscious alignment with the organization's needs.  At a micro level, it can be exhibited in an effort to make each of their words and actions matter.
