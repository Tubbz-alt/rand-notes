**Focus on Facts and Restrict the Flow of Misinformation**  
Do your part to restrict the flow of misinformation.  During outbreaks like the current COVID-19 pandemic, the spread of information that is known to be incorrect can lead to unhealthy behaviors and reinforce disinformation used to drive people to mistrust scientists and governments -- which results in their being less likely to follow advisories and take appropriate precautions.  

Here is a resource to fact check information related to COVID-19:

**...as an individual**  
* Practice strict social distancing, especially if you are in a vulnerable group.
Remember that even if you are not super vulnerable, many people around you are; follow these practices to protect others.  
* Wash your hands "like you just chopped a jalapeno and have to change a contact lens."  
* Stay home as much as possible -- especially if you are sick; be prepared with extra supplies in case you need to self-quarantine.  
* If you are an employer, encourage your employees to work from home wherever possible.  

**...as an official**  
* Make testing free and broadly available. [*You can do this.  Testing only a portion of hospitalized individuals will not help leaders make informed-enough decisions about 'what next' and may result in decisions that negatively impact population health and mortality*]  
* Put strong social distancing measures in place.  
* Fund and implement extensive contact tracing efforts. [*Without this, leaders cannot make informed-enough decisions about 'what next' and may result in decisions that negatively impact population health and mortality*]  
* Financially support those impacted by social distancing measures.
